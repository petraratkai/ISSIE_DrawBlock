# Changes after demo
- Swapped the order of the Sum and Cout ports in adder
- Fixed crashing issue when loading a sheet due to incorrect initialisation of symbols

# Known Bugs
- If a port is added/removed to/from a custom component (renaming a port by replacing a port is fine though), the custom component isn't updated correctly in other sheets (despite selecting update on the prompt). We didn't know that this was something we needed to consider (until about 2 hours before the deadline). This causes existing instances of the custom component in other sheets to not re-size themselves. If any of these ports are attempted to be moved to other sides of the component, they end up floating (but this can be reset by trying to move a different port). Wires can still be drawn to and from the ports in the component. This can be worked around by manually deleting the old custom component and putting a new one back in, but this obviously isn't ideal ( sorry :( ). Basically if you change the number of ports on a custom component, you'll need to manually replace instances of that component in other sheets. After testing the original version of Issie, this was not supported either (maybe change the message to not allow users to update components in other sheets / warn users to replace their components?).
