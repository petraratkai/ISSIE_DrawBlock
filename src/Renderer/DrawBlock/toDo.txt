add rotation for symbols

add defualt port positions for mux DFFE, REGE, ADDER etc

change the way text is generated for rotated symbols



"Add rotation, adjustable edge for custom comp ports (this also changes port
orientation). Adjustable order for ports"

Make MUX + etc symbols better with ports on other edges 1A,1B – MUX,DFFE,REGE,ADDER

Add 90, 180, 270 degree rotation (simple symbols)

Make custom components that contain clocked logic have a clock on their
symbol (like Reg, RegE). This would not be a port – just a visual indicator.
